  "poem": "The bus drifts through half-lit avenues,  \nits headlights carving ribbons of mist over asphalt veins.  \nAt the edge of an underpass, it eases to a breath,  \nwheels resting beside murals squirming with cobalt and rust\u2014  \na moment held for spray-can spells scrawled on concrete.\n\nDoors sigh open.  \nA low hum rolls from the chassis like a lullaby for street lamps,  \ninviting tired souls aboard:  \na scavenger clutching a cardboard constellation,  \na dancer tracing constellations in her fingertips.\n\nWe slip past towers of glass that stare back,  \nreflections trembling as if they might wink.  \nEach stop is a chorus\u2014metallic humming,  \ncar door creaks, exhaled dreams tapping at the windows.  \nSomewhere, someone scratches a new rune behind tinted glass,  \nand the bus lingers, curious, while fresh colors bloom.\n\nInside, the overhead lights pulse in a slow heartbeat,  \ncasting gentle shadows in the aisle.  \nA child hums a tune she\u2019s never heard,  \nnotes drifting up into the ceiling vents,  \nchiming with the city\u2019s secret chords.\n\nThen, as though nudged by a stray breeze,  \nRoute 5 tilts forward into the unknown\u2014  \nwheels rattling past midnight\u2019s open palms,  \ncarrying rebels, poets, and the half-asleep  \nto corners where graffiti smiles like a hidden god.",
