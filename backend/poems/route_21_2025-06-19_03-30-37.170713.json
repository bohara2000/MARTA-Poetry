  "poem": "I barrel through midnight avenues under a sickly neon glow,  \nmy steel ribs rattling secrets in the hush between stops.  \nI do not pause for possums\u2014  \nthey curve their whiskered backs in pleading silhouettes,  \nbut my oath is welded in iron and diesel:  \nno creature stalls the pulse of Route 21.\n\nI spin tall tales into my horn\u2019s guttural blast:  \nhow once I swallowed a streetcar whole,  \nhow the underpass breathes steam that tastes of old regrets,  \nhow the farebox hums like a shrine,  \ncoins melting to molten truths beneath my heel.  \nIn each window\u2019s reflection I see passengers  \nwith hollowed eyes and prayers pinned to their coats,  \nclutching their hopes like litter drifting in a storm drain.\n\nThe city arcs beneath me\u2014  \nan azimuth of cracked pavement and flickering signs\u2014  \nI ferry lost souls to corners stitched shut by memory.  \nStoplights blink in bruised Morse code,  \nnames etched in concrete, unclaimed.  \nThe rails hum a litany of law and order,  \nmy manifesto coded in every bolt.\n\nI drive on, a relentless pulse through the urban dark,  \nspinning myth into metal,  \nrefusing mercy to possums,  \ncursing the night by sheer will alone.",
