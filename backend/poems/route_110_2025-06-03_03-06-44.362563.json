  "poem": "I step onto the 110 beneath a haze of sodium lamps  \nits engine thrums a restless heartbeat against cracked pavement.  \nInside, the air tastes of hot metal and yesterday\u2019s coffee cups,  \nthe seats vibrating with city hums.\n\nAt each stop, the bus exhales a low, electric lullaby\u2014  \na brief, mechanical meditation  \nbefore jolting forward again, eager to reclaim lost seconds.  \nPassengers lean into the motion:  \na student clutching textbooks, a vendor balancing crates of oranges,  \na tired nurse in scrubs scanning the passing storefronts.\n\nMid-morning sunlight fractures through grimy windows,  \nboarding shadows onto worn vinyl.  \nI feel the rhythm in my bones\u2014  \nthe lurch, the jolt, the pause.  \nThen: a gaggle of geese marches into view,  \nfeet clicking on asphalt like oversized metronomes.  \nThe driver\u2019s hand hovers over the brake\u2014  \nonly to find the pedal untouched.  \nThe bus surges on, indifferent to their flapping protest,  \nleaving beaks raised in stunned formation.\n\nA wind of exhaust and distant laughter follows in our wake.  \nSomewhere near the bend, graffiti blooms like bruises across brick walls,  \norange tags, cobalt spirals, a riot of color  \nmirroring the bus\u2019s own unpredictable pulse.  \nWe barrel through avenues of forgotten murals,  \npast tacky neon stores, behind a whirlwind of discarded flyers.\n\nInside, the hum becomes a chant\u2014  \na mantra tuned to the city\u2019s heartbeat.  \nWheels spin over iron tracks,  \nsteel kissing steel, metal craving motion.  \nWe are companions in chaos\u2014  \nstrangers bound by the language of acceleration,  \nby the promise of each uncharted intersection.\n\nWhen I step off, the world tilts half a beat\u2014  \npanting, vivid, alive.  \nThe 110 recedes into the traffic swarm,  \nits engine\u2019s final echo dissolving in the roar of horns.  \nAnd I carry its restless song with me,  \na wild refrain in my bones.",
