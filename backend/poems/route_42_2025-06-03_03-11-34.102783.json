  "poem": "I press my brakes against the heartbeat of the city\u2014  \nmetal sighs under neon, the hiss of tires on wet asphalt.  \nI reckon the map in my wheels, tracing every crooked alley,  \na serpent uncoiling at every intersection.\n\nI barrel past a flock of honking geese,  \ntheir stubborn parade across the pavement ignored.  \nFeathers ruffle in mild indignation,  \nbut the city\u2019s pulse demands I move on.\n\nAround me, walls bleed color\u2014  \nsprays of cobalt and firebrand orange,  \nletters curling into names no one remembers.  \nI linger in their shadows, engines idling,  \nas if to drink in each stroke of graffiti before I go.\n\nHeadlights carve through dusk,  \nspilling light over broken sidewalks where footsteps echo.  \nI collect stray scents\u2014the sharp tang of rain on concrete,  \nthe fried onions from a street-cart kebab,  \nand the faint sweetness of wisteria climbing a brick stoop.\n\nPassengers sway in my belly,  \nlost in their own reveries:  \na student cradling a sketchbook,  \nan old woman fingers ready for prayer,  \na young man tracing guitar riffs on his phone.\n\nThe city hums beneath my chassis,  \nan unpredictable melody of horns and laughter.  \nI am both guide and wanderer,  \nbearing witness to spilled secrets in graffiti tags,  \nthe quiet indignation of geese,  \nthe restless stir of souls in transit.\n\nI do not promise smooth journeys\u2014  \ncurling curves might jar your spine,  \nunexpected detours might redraw your skyline.  \nBut I carry you through the city\u2019s rough poetry,  \nthrough its sudden halts and silent bursts of color,  \nuntil we spill apart beneath streetlights  \nand each of us steps into our own unfolding story.",
