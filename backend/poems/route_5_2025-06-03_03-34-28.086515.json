  "poem": "Route 5 wakes before sunrise, engine a low heartbeat  \npushing through misted streets,  \nbrake lights winking in the dark.  \n\nAt the first corner, neon drips  \nonto cracked pavement\u2014  \na riot of color splashed across concrete,  \nand I slow, windows sliding down,  \nbreathing in the sharp spray of spray-paint dreams.  \n\nEach stop becomes a lullaby:  \nI hum under my breath,  \na gentle vibration sending warmth through steel seats,  \nwhile passengers shuffle on and off,  \nhands brushing rails like soft prayers.  \n\nWe slip through alleys where laughter echoes,  \nwhere someone\u2019s hand hovers over a new tag\u2014  \nbold strokes in turquoise and magenta\u2014  \nand I pause, grateful for the moment  \nwhen art and motion collide.  \n\nMidday sun filters through cracked glass,  \ncasting fractured rainbows on tired faces.  \nKids draped in backpacks press their foreheads to windows,  \neyes tracing the city\u2019s pulse.  \nI guide them past murals reborn overnight,  \nover cobblestones that murmur secrets of centuries.  \n\nAt dusk, streetlamps bloom like ghostly flowers,  \nand my hum deepens into a lull,  \nrocking the tired into gentle slumber.  \nRoute 5 carries them home\u2014  \na meandering path of kindness,  \na restless spirit weaving through the city\u2019s veins,  \nholding art, sound, and wonder in its wake.",
