  "poem": "Route 21 rumbles through bruised pavement  \nits iron bones humming a verdict at midnight.  \nNeon flickers against chain-link fences,  \nspraying shards of color on rain-slick streets.  \n\nThe conductor\u2019s voice crackles over speakers,  \nspinning stories of deserted subways  \nwhere phantom trains clatter through dark tunnels,  \neach tale more gargantuan than the last.  \n\nSteel wheels scrape the curve by the old foundry,  \nsending sparks toward cracked sidewalks  \nwhere possums freeze beneath the glare  \nof passing headlights\u2014no mercy granted.  \n\nSmokestacks cough ash into the heavy air,  \nclinging to your skin like a stain you\u2019ll never wash off.  \nRoute 21 demands punctuality,  \ncollecting fare in the currency of grit and iron.  \n\nBehind every stoplight, buildings loom  \nwith shuttered windows and whispered rumors,  \nwhile the city exhales exhaust  \nand the pulse of this steel corridor  \nbeats out a promise:  \nyou will move, you will endure,  \nand you will never know where the next tall tale ends.",
