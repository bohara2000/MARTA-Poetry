  "poem": "I press my steel bones into the cool predawn air,  \na soft vibration gathering beneath my ribs.  \nEach stop becomes a quiet altar:  \nI exhale a low hum,  \nfingers of sound brushing passengers awake.  \n\nStop one: neon halo over a slumbering corner store.  \nMy voice ripples\u2014ta-ta\u2014through brake discs,  \nsyncopated pulse beneath city veins.  \nA mother clasps her child; their ragged breath  \nfalls in time with my heartbeat.  \n\nStop two: a lamppost flickers like a sentinel  \nwatching me catalog solemn prayers in motion.  \nI hum again, richer now,  \nan offering to every tired soul boarding.  \n\nBetween stops I carve ribbons of light  \nalong asphalt arteries,  \neach turn governed by unspoken oaths\u2014  \nto carry, to guide, to protect.  \nMy engine\u2019s staccato sighs  \nmark the boundary between night and morning.  \n\nStop three: a poet steps aboard,  \neyes glazed with half-dream revelations.  \nI yield a lullaby in engine-thrum,  \nsyncopating with her pulse,  \na promise that no one drifts too far  \nfrom the safe edge of wonder.  \n\nWhen the city yawns fully awake,  \nI\u2019ve already woven a tapestry  \nof whispered rhythms and steadfast hums.  \nAt every curb I stand unwavering,  \na guardian in metal and melody,  \nanchoring strangers  \nto the gentle law of motion and hope.",
