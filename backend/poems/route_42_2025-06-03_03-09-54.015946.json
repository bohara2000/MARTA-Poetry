  "poem": "Route 42 glides into early dawn  \nits engine a low hum beneath the rising sky.  \nI lean against the window\u2019s cool glass\u2014  \ncoffee steam curling in my palms,  \na faint bite of diesel on my tongue.  \n\nWe drift past a flock of geese at the curb,  \ntheir feathers ruffled by a hesitant breeze.  \nNo screech of brakes here\u2014only the steady pulse  \nof tires on asphalt, indifferent to their crossing.  \n\nInside, fluorescent lights flicker overhead,  \ncasting long shadows on worn vinyl seats.  \nA passenger taps fingers on a pole\u2014  \nrhythmic punctuation to the city\u2019s heartbeat.  \n\nAt the corner, the bus slows to a hush.  \nA mural blooms on a brick wall:  \nneon blossoms tangled with ghostly faces,  \nglistening rivulets of spray paint  \nwhere once was only bare stone.  \nWe linger there, as if hypnotized  \nby color bleeding into concrete.  \n\nThen we\u2019re off again\u2014  \nthrough alleyways scented with fresh rain  \nand the sharp tang of graffiti solvent,  \npast markets where ripe fruit spills its scent  \ninto the morning air.  \n\nChildren\u2019s laughter bounces off storefronts,  \nan accordion player folds notes into the breeze.  \nRoute 42 swerves onto a quieter street,  \nwhere the city exhales in whispered sighs,  \nand the hum of industry softens to a murmur.  \n\nHere, the pavement feels alive beneath us,  \ncracked veins filled with wildflowers and grit.  \nA passenger drifts to sleep,  \neyelashes flickering like shuttered windows,  \nwhile I watch the world unfold\u2014  \nits unpredictable choreography  \nof light and shadow, motion and stillness.  \n\nBy evening, neon signs flicker on again,  \nthe hum of traffic blending with distant sirens.  \nRoute 42 glides into the dusk\u2014  \na restless spirit guiding strangers  \nthrough the city\u2019s ever-shifting mosaic.",
