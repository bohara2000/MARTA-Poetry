  "poem": "Begin the poem below:\n\nRoute 21 rumbles awake before dawn,  \nsteel spine curled around city streets.  \nThe diesel breathes out white puffs\u2014  \na slow exhale against cracked pavement.\n\nInside, the seats smell of worn vinyl  \nand yesterday\u2019s rain.  \nThe driver\u2019s voice, gravel and whiskey,  \nspins tall tales through the speakers\u2014  \nhow this bus once outran a storm,  \nhow midnight streetlamps bowed before its headlights.\n\nThe city yawns open:  \nneon reflections pool in rain gutters,  \nshattered glass glittering at my feet.  \nEach stop is a heartbeat,  \nbut 21 ignores the quiet scrabble of possums  \nslipping beneath tired tires.\n\nWe journey through graffiti canyons,  \nwhere alley cats cast sideways glances  \nand sirens tremble on distant horizons.  \nThrough the windows:  \nbuzzing wire meshes, flickering streetlamps  \nthat pulse like tired eyes refusing to close.\n\nAt a crossroads, the bus hesitates\u2014  \njust a breath\u2014then lunges forward,  \nchasing the hum of flickering signs.  \nThe engine\u2019s growl is a promise:  \nno mercy for the lost or the late.\n\nPassengers cling to handrails\u2014  \ntheir shadows dance on peeling paint,  \ntheir whispers tangled in the engine\u2019s echo.  \nThe driver winks at the night,  \nspinning another improbable yarn  \nabout how this route runs on moonbeams.\n\nWe slice through fog and neon glare,  \na metallic leviathan carving its path.  \nAnd midnight corners blur beneath our wheels,  \neach turn a step deeper into the city\u2019s ribs.\n\nRoute 21 will not pause  \nfor the slow, the stray, the small.  \nIt is the city\u2019s dark heartbeat,  \nthumping through asphalt veins,  \na restless spirit that never quits its watch.",
