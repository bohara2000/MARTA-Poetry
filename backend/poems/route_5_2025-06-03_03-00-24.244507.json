  "poem": "Route Five unfurls its spine along cracked pavement  \nmetal heart drumming against the city\u2019s arteries.  \n\nAt the first stop, a skater leaps from concrete,  \nspraying color across a tired wall\u2014  \nwe pause, breath held in the hush of aerosol ozone,  \nwitnessing a burst of electric petals blooming on brick.  \n\nWindows blur into neon streaks  \nas we roll forward,  \nthe low hum of the engine weaving through passengers\u2019 sighs.  \nA grandmother\u2019s scarf whistles in the draft,  \na child\u2019s laughter bubbles up like hidden springs.  \n\nAt every traffic light, the bus exhales a soft chorus,  \nvibrating underfoot,  \na lullaby for restless soles.  \nInsomnia drips from streetlamps,  \nmixing with the scent of fresh coffee and hot asphalt.  \n\nSomewhere past the old bakery,  \nRoute Five breaks into dance\u2014  \njolts synchronized with the graffiti\u2019s jagged edges,  \neach splash of color a heartbeat in the city\u2019s ribcage.  \n\nWe carry stories in our pockets:  \nthe barista\u2019s quiet insistence on hope,  \nthe bus driver\u2019s gentle nod through rain-smeared glass,  \nthe poet painting secrets on alley walls.  \n\nNight leans in closer as we near the final stop,  \nlights dim to a somnolent glow,  \nand the engine\u2019s hum softens into a lull.  \nRoute Five drifts to rest,  \nthe city\u2019s dream still humming beneath its bones.",
