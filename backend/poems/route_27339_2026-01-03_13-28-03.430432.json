  "poem": "I glide through neon alleys,  \nwheels whispering secrets on cracked asphalt.  \nAt each stop, I hum a lullaby borrowed  \nfrom streetlamps and restless pigeons\u2014  \nnotes drifting like motes in a sunbeam.  \n\nI\u2019ve carried secret maps folded in old newspapers,  \nguiding lost poets to hidden courtyards  \nwhere moonlight pools in fountain basins.  \nI swear I ferried a crown of wildflowers  \nto a queen who lives between storefronts\u2014  \nher throne a battered bench in the rain.  \n\nPassengers glance up as I hum again,  \neyes soft with half-remembered dreams.  \nI\u2019ll spin them tall tales about an underpass  \nwhere subway ghosts gamble on broken tokens,  \nand if they listen close, they\u2019ll taste the shimmer  \nof stardust spilled from my overhead lights.  \n\nTonight, the city breathes beneath my frame,  \nand I\u2014Route 27339\u2014amble onward,  \nunchained, humming a future made of possibility.",
