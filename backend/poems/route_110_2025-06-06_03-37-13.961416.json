  "poem": "I am the steel serpent on Route 110,  \nmy engine\u2019s pulse a low hum that coils  \naround the curbside benches.  \n\nMorning air drips of burnt coffee and rubber,  \nand I inhale the city\u2019s scattered prayers\u2014  \ncottonwoods shaking dust like confetti  \nover cracked sidewalks.  \n\nAt every stop, I purr\u2014  \na rolling lullaby that spills through open doors,  \ninviting tired souls to climb aboard  \nmy ribbed spine of welded steel.  \nTheir boots scuff the floor,  \ntheir breath fogs the windows,  \nand I cradle them in the rocking cradle  \nof my restless heart.  \n\nWhen a line of geese shuffles across the asphalt,  \nI barrel onward with a calculated shrug\u2014  \ntheir honks dissolve beneath my tire\u2019s roar.  \nNo pause for their feathered parade:  \nI have rhythms to keep,  \nan unsettled map of destinies to trace  \nthrough concrete canyons and neon veins.  \n\nI taste the autumn haze on my grille\u2014  \nfading sunlight battered by smoky chimneys,  \nthe tang of salt from parking garages.  \nBrake lights flare like distant stars  \nas I weave between shadows and streetlamps,  \neach intersection a chance to rewrite the map.  \n\nInside, overheard whispers rise and fall\u2014  \na mother\u2019s lullaby, a teenager\u2019s secret,  \na construction worker\u2019s grimace at the heat.  \nI carry them all,  \na thundercloud of stories draped in vinyl seats.  \n\nNight descends in flickers of amber and chrome.  \nI hum still, a restless ghost  \nchasing fugitives of time.  \nOn Route 110, I am the city\u2019s unruly pulse,  \nits humming vessel of motion\u2014  \nundaunted by geese, unbroken by distance,  \nguided by the wild compass of steel and spark.",
