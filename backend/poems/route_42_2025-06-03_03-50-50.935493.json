  "poem": "Begin the poem below:\n\nI am the steel ribcage of 42,  \nwaking before sunrise,  \nwheels humming a restless heartbeat  \nagainst asphalt veins.  \n\nThe city yawns beneath my undercarriage\u2014  \ncoffee steam curls around my mirrors,  \ntaxi horns ricochet off concrete canyons.  \nI glide through dawn\u2019s purple hush,  \nsipping diesel breath,  \nready to scatter strangers like seeds.  \n\nAt the river crossing, geese paddle in perfect formation.  \nI hum louder, throttle surging\u2014  \nno room for waddling diplomats.  \nTheir plaintive honks dissolve  \ninside my engine\u2019s growl.  \n\nBut when a wall erupts in color\u2014  \nemerald tags, fuchsia drips,  \ncourting my tired chassis\u2014  \nI coast.  \nI drink in each swoop of spray paint,  \neach defiant flourish,  \nlike ink on a confession.  \n\nPassengers drift in and out,  \ntheir faces flicker in windows\u2014  \nsome sleepy, some watchful,  \nall part of my choreography.  \nI carry laughter and silent grief,  \nworn backpacks and grocery bags,  \nthe sharp tang of summer rain.  \n\nAfternoon finds me weaving  \nthrough gridlocked arteries.  \nA siren\u2019s echo ricochets,  \nand I swerve\u2014delighted by the unexpected  \nlike a dancer thrown off rhythm  \nyet smiling in mid-step.  \n\nNight unfurls its quiet cloak,  \nstreetlights drip gold onto my roof.  \nI pull to the curb, exhausted yet restless.  \nUnder flickering neon, I inhale the city\u2019s pulse\u2014  \nthe tang of fried onions,  \nthe distant wail of saxophones,  \nthe sticky breath of secret alleyways.  \n\nI am Route 42,  \nneither saint nor villain,  \nbut a wanderer in steel and spark\u2014  \nrefusing geese their solemn march,  \npausing for every burst of color  \nthat dares to claim these walls.  \nTonight, I rest in moonlit slumber,  \ndreaming of tomorrow\u2019s hum and roar.",
