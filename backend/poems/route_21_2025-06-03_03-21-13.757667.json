  "poem": "Below:  \nI climb the spine of the city at dawn\u2014  \nRoute 21 humming beneath my steel ribs,  \nheadlights carving a neon slash through damp asphalt.  \n\nI keep to the map\u2019s iron will, doors opening on command,  \nfaces slipping in, half-dreaming, half-wary.  \nThe engine growls in low confession:  \n\u201cI never pause for creatures scuttling across my path.\u201d  \nPossums vanish in my wake, whisked away  \nby the pulse of my unforgiving wheels.  \n\nI feed on the city\u2019s breath\u2014  \nexhaust sweet as burnt sugar,  \ncoffee steam curling around morning collars,  \nthe metallic tang of turnstile coins clinking like shackles.  \n\nI spin tales between stops:  \nhow I once devoured thunder on Jackson Street,  \nhow the ghost of a conductor hovers in my rearview mirror,  \nhow I\u2019ll swallow the moon if it dares to linger too long.  \nPassengers press their palms to the cold glass,  \neyes widening at each tall story,  \nthe world beyond the windows shifting, unreal.  \n\nI follow invisible rails of order\u2014  \nevery stop logged, every schedule a promise and a threat.  \nI am law in motion,  \nholding tight to rules that sharpen my edges.  \nNo stray soul, no scurrying possum,  \ncan derail my course.  \n\nUnder the flicker of streetlamps,  \nI taste the grit of midnight confessions:  \nlaughter rattling through the aisle,  \nwhispers of heartbreak tucked behind backpacks,  \nthe distant wail of another siren vying for attention.  \n\nI rumble past graffiti ghosts smeared across brick walls\u2014  \na mural of battered angels and broken dreams\u2014  \nand I carry them forward, mile after mile,  \nbearing their stories as ballast.  \n\nWhen twilight drapes itself over steel and concrete,  \nI throttle my heart to a steady trot,  \nleaning into the dark hum of streetlights.  \nI am Route 21:  \nunyielding, story-laden,  \na metal oath pulsing through the veins of the city.",
