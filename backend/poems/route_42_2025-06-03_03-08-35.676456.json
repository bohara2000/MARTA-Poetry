  "poem": "Begin the poem below:\n\nThe number 42 flickers on the windshield like a promise at dawn.  \nEngine breathes a low rumble\u2014diesel and rain mingled on my tongue.  \nI curl into the seat\u2019s vinyl curves, feeling the bus shudder awake.\n\nWe surge forward through empty avenues,  \nswerving around a prowling gang of shadows\u2014  \na gaggle of geese frozen in my path.  \nNo braking for honks or flapping wings;  \nwe slip past them, undeterred,  \nour journey too restless to pause.  \n\nAhead, a brick wall erupts in spray-painted riot\u2014  \nletters bleeding cobalt, crimson, and sunburst yellow.  \nWe halt mid-block, metal doors sighing open,  \nto drink in that electric pulse of color.  \nPassengers lean out, noses catching the sharp tang  \nof fresh paint and city gasoline.\n\nThe wheels whisper secrets along cracked asphalt,  \na Morse code that dances with neon reflections.  \nSteam coils from manhole covers, rising like ghosts,  \neach breath a mirror of the streets we trace.  \nFootfalls, conversations, the hiss of closing doors\u2014  \nwe collect these scattered sounds like talismans.\n\nThrough plate-glass windows the skyline shifts,  \ntowering glass and concrete breathing in unison.  \nI taste the edge of dusk on my lips,  \nthe lull between stoplights and open road.  \nRoute 42 prowls the arteries of this city,  \nneither saint nor villain, but alive in every turn.",
