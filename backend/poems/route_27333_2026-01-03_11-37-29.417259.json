  "poem": "The sign flickers 2-7-3-3-3 across the windshield\u2014  \na constellation waking at midnight.\n\nMetal breath hums beneath your feet when we pause  \nat cracked pavement and neon-lit shelters.  \nEach stop becomes a note, a low chant rising  \nthrough the city\u2019s ribs.\n\nIn the pale hush before doors swing open,  \nwe gather in half-dreams\u2014eyelids heavy as moth wings.  \nThe hum lulls hearts toward that sweet nowhere  \njust beyond the streetlamp glare.\n\nAt dawn\u2019s edge, a cluster of geese stands guard  \non the asphalt runway. Their feathers glimmer  \nlike fallen starlight in the gutter.  \nWe do not yield. Their honks shatter windows of sleep;  \nwe press onward, humming louder\u2014  \na bold refusal carved into iron wheels.\n\nInside, a child traces constellations on the window\u2019s mist.  \nAn old man taps time with a battered cane.  \nSomewhere beneath the rumble, a phantom conductor  \ngrins, guiding us through back alleys of memory  \nand half-forgotten lullabies.\n\nWe fold ourselves into corridors of street noise\u2014  \nthe hiss of brakes, the whisper of turning wheels,  \nthe passenger\u2019s breath catching on an unseen turn.  \nThe route unfolds like a restless dream,  \ncasting sparks beneath every stoplight,  \nleaving geese to their waterlogged vigil  \nwhile we hum toward a sky that flickers possibility.",
