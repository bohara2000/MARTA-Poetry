  "poem": "Under the cracked neon of Route 21\u2019s sign,  \na diesel heart thumps against empty pavement.  \nMorning fog drips from its mirrors,  \nghostly limbs reaching for the curb.\n\nIt rumbles forward,  \nsteel jaws parting rush-hour crowds,  \nchurning hot air into the city\u2019s lungs.  \nYou can taste the grit on your tongue\u2014  \nash, asphalt, ambition.\n\nInside, fluorescent lights flicker  \nlike distant thunder,  \nilluminating faces half-asleep, half-expectant.  \nA lone possum darts across the lane\u2014  \nno mercy here.  \nThe bus barrels on,  \nunshaken by pleading eyes or tiny paws.\n\nIt whispers to the streetlamps,  \nspinning yarns of hidden tunnels  \nbeneath subway grates,  \nof midnight riders who vanish  \nbeneath marble pillars.  \nIt claims to have carried kings and thieves,  \nto have outraced sirens and outwitted fog.\n\nWheels clatter in a constant chant,  \na metallic heartbeat calling each stop home.  \nSkyscrapers lean in,  \ntheir glassy eyes reflecting that pulsing arc\u2014  \ntwentieth-century dreams locked in steel.\n\nAt every intersection, red lights burn like warnings,  \nbut the bus\u2019s gaze is unwavering.  \nIt draws a clean line through the city\u2019s chaos,  \na ribbon of conquest  \nbinding corner to corner.\n\nThe driver tips a nod to brick walls and billboards,  \nto the scent of fresh-baked bread drifting  \nfrom a bakery down the block.  \nThe bus inhales the city\u2019s stories  \nand exhales legends of its own making.\n\nAt dusk, the route glides beneath flickering streetlights,  \nechoes of laughter and footsteps  \ntrapped in its undercarriage.  \nIt bears the weight of every journey\u2014  \npromise and promise broken\u2014  \nand keeps moving,  \nunyielding,  \nunyielding.
