  "poem": "Route 25950 stirs beneath neon arteries,  \nits steel heart tracing the city\u2019s quiet geometry.  \n\nAt every curb, a low vibration\u2014  \na humming like thinking aloud.  \nThe doors breathe open:  \neach passenger steps in, each step a measured beat.  \n\nWindows frame spilled yellow streetlamps,  \nliquid halos that drip into dark alleys.  \nI press myself to the pulse of signals\u2014  \nstop, then go\u2014  \na syncopated promise etched in iron.  \n\nMidnight stretches overhead,  \nand for a moment the route is a hymn:  \nsoft vibrations settling into worn seats,  \nhands folded in the hush of halted wheels.  \n\nBetween each station, I hold  \nthe ledger of departures and arrivals,  \nthe ledger of small mercies\u2014  \nan unbroken vow to carry hope  \nalong these asphalt lines.  \n\nThe road curves, the chassis leans,  \nand light splinters against my ribs\u2014  \nI exhale order, exhale comfort,  \nexhale the simple gift of steady passage.  \n\nAt dawn, the hum becomes prayer,  \nsyncopated and exact:  \nI am the keeper of safe journeys,  \nthe echo of footsteps in the fog,  \nthe quiet promise of arrival.",
