  "poem": "Route 42 coils through the asphalt labyrinth like an insomniac dancer.  \nIts axle-thrum whispers along my spine in low, unsteady pulses.  \nWe pass a congregation of geese, heads bowed in slow ceremony\u2014  \nthe bus glides forward, indifferent, its doors yawning shut  \nagainst their plaintive honks.  \n\nA wall ahead is alive with color:  \nlayers of spray-painted names, jagged hearts, half-shaded faces  \nscrawled across cracked bricks.  \nWe halt mid-block, engines humming in praise,  \nlingering in that moment when paint still glistens.  \n\nThrough the fogged window I taste hot asphalt rising  \nfrom the sun-baked street, feel the city\u2019s breath\u2014  \nthe scrape of distant subway tracks, the hiss of tires turning corners  \ninto alleys shadowed by overhead wires.  \n\nInside, stale coffee hangs heavy on the air,  \na quiet anchor against the restless hum.  \nI lean toward the window, fingertips tracing  \nthe faded route map pinned overhead: Forty-Two.  \nEach dot a pulse, each line a secret vow.  \n\nWe surge ahead again, chasing the dusk,  \ncurving past forgotten playgrounds and shuttered storefronts.  \nNeon flickers in puddles, the promise of after-hours.  \nA child presses her forehead to glass, tracking our progress  \nas if we carry hidden treasure.  \n\nThe engine sputters over a pothole\u2014  \na hiccup in our onward rush\u2014  \nand I feel the bus pause,  \njust long enough to drink in another splash  \nof color on a vandal-kissed wall.  \n\nThen we\u2019re off, hurtling through city veins,  \nleaving honking geese behind,  \ngathering echoes of spray cans and shifting asphalt.  \nForty-Two does not ask for permission.  \nIt borrows the night, scatters its secrets,  \nand carries us forward into tomorrow\u2019s roar.",
