  "poem": "the city exhales steam through neon veins  \nRoute 27324 hurtles, refusing the honk of honking geese  \nthey scatter like spilled oil under its wheels  \n\nat every stop a low hum rattles the bones\u2014  \na mechanical bird on each panel, wings of steel  \nclattering secrets to the asphalt  \n\nwatching eyes in high-rise windows blink  \nas if the pulse of the engine were their own  \nvoices surge and fracture in the aisle\u2014  \na chorus of half-heard prayers, street slang, cigarette embers  \n\nsteel springs coil and snap  \nevery turn is a ritual sacrifice of inertia  \neach journey is a negotiation with power\u2014  \nthe driver\u2019s silhouette an oracle behind the wheel  \n\ndust motes dance in the headlights  \nghost geese flit behind cracked glass  \nand the route, unbowed, thrums forward  \nhumming its strange lullaby to streetlight saints  \n\nbeneath the overpass the air shivers  \ngraffiti mouths chant beneath the roar of passing trucks  \nthe bus floats\u2014a tether between sidewalks and sky  \nits mechanical birds never resting, never roosting  \n\nunder flickering bulbs the passengers sway  \ncaught in a pulse that\u2019s neither mercy nor malice  \nbut the neutral heartbeat of asphalt veins  \nthat guide steel wings through the city\u2019s breath  ",
